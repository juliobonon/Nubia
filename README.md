# Nubia

Nubia is a overlay that catchs the Warframe information and gets information about prices, lists and other.


## Why

Lazy to reverse engineer the client requests so I made a open-source overlay that everyone can see what's going on.
It's not deterministic because it tries to match whatever it seems in the screen to any sellable item.
